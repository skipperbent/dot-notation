# dot-notation
Dot notation support for JSON-like syntax for easily creating arrays in PHP.

## Installation
Add the latest version of dot-notation to your ```composer.json```

```json
{
    "require": {
        "pecee/dot-notation": "1.*"
    },
    "require-dev": {
        "pecee/dot-notation": "1.*"
    }
}
```

## Example

This example returns an array from a basic dot formatted string, simular to the JSON syntax:

```php
$d = new \Pecee\DotNotation(['one' => ['two' => 2]]);
echo $d->getValues();
```

**output:**

```php
['one' => ['two' => 2]]
```
